What is Rotter ?
----------------

Rotter is a Recording of Transmission / Audio Logger. It was designed for use 
by radio stations, who are legally required to keep a recording of all their 
output. Rotter runs continuously, writing to a new file every hour. 


Rotter can output files in two different strutures, either all files in a 
single directory or create a directory structure:

flat: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
hierarchy: /root_directory/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/archive.suffix

The advantage of using a folder hierarchy is that you can store related 
files in the hour's directory.


Usage
-----

rotter [options] <directory>
   -a            Automatically connect JACK ports
   -f <format>   Format of recording [mp2/mp3]
   -b <bitrate>  Bitrate of recording
   -c <channels> Number of channels
   -n <name>     Name for this JACK client
   -d <hours>    Delete files in directory older than this
   -R <secs>     Length of the ring buffer (in seconds)
   -H            Create folder hierarchy instead of flat files
   -j            Don't automatically start jackd
   -v            Enable verbose mode
   -q            Enable quiet mode


Example:
rooter -a -f mp3 -d 1000 -b 128 -v /var/achives

Start logging audio to hourly files in /var/archives.
Rotter will automatically connect itself to the first two JACK output ports 
it finds and encode to MPEG Layer 3 audio at 128kbps. Each hour it will 
delete files older than 1000 hours (42 days). Verbose mode means it will 
display more informational messages.
