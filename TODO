Rotter TODO List
================

In order of priority:
 
 _ add MP3/LAME support
 
 - Make sure we stay on the same device when deleting files
 
 - Make codec libraries optional at compile time
    (so if you only want to encode to MP3, you only need lame)
    
 - Support other formats?
 	- PCM audio/libsndfile
 	- FLAC
 	- Ogg Vorbis
