Rotter TODO List
================

In order of priority:
 
 - Make sure that libsndfile based formats append to file after rotter crashes
 
 - Use mutex and conditions, like in the Jack capture client example
 
 - Make hourly file change more accurate by having a second ring buffer

 - Support SFC_SET_VBR_ENCODING_QUALITY for setting VBR encoding quality

 - Support SFC_SET_BROADCAST_INFO to set Broadcast Extention chunk for WAV files

 - Support other libsndfile options (e.g. clipping) ?
